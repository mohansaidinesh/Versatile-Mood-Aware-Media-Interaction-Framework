# Versatile Mood Aware Media Interaction Framework

## Abstract

#### The project aims to develop a multilingual emotion detection system that uses facial and text-based recognition. It uses manual data collection to accurately identify and categorize emotions, and allows users to input their emotions directly. The system recommends personalized content, enhancing the user experience by providing culturally diverse and emotionally resonant suggestions.
